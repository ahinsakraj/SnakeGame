# SnakeGame
This project is a snake game which features a snake and food for snake at any random place
inside the frame. The game was built using java swing and some other basic and advance java concepts.
The code was set in VS code environment so it might cause some errors while opening in other editors like
IntelliJ but issues can be fixed as only problem can be loading the images. Rest of all code and logic is same.
